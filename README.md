# Viewnior - Fast and elegant image viewer

This is a fork of the Gtk3 port :  
https://github.com/Artturin/Viewnior  
From the original project by Siyan Panayotov :  
https://github.com/hellosiyan/Viewnior  

This is Viewnior, an image viewer program. Created to be simple, fast and elegant. Its minimalistic interface provides more screenspace for your images. Among its features are:

  * Fullscreen & Slideshow
  * Rotate, flip, crop, save, delete images
  * Animation support
  * Browse only selected images
  * Navigation window
  * Set image as wallpaper (Gnome 2, Gnome 3, XFCE, MATE, Cinnamon, LXDE, FluxBox, Nitrogen, Puppylinux)
  * EXIF and IPTC metadata
  * Simple interface
  * Configurable mouse actions

Most of the Viewnior's sources handling image viewing are adopted from the GtkImageView library by Bj√∂rn Lindqvist. The files were cleaned up and modified, so that unused functionalities were removed (GtkImageToolSelector, GtkImageToolPainter, GtkZooms). Prefixes were changed from gtk_ to uni_ for clarity.

This package requires the following modules to be installed: GTK+, glib, gio, exiv2, shared-mime-info.
