## Viewnior - Fast and elegant image viewer

This is a fork of Viewnior Gtk3 :

From the original project by Siyan Panayotov :

Viewnior is an image viewer, created to be simple, fast and elegant. Its minimalistic interface provides more screenspace for your images. Among its features are:

  * Rotate, flip, crop, save, delete images
  * Copy, move, rename
  * Fullscreen & Slideshow
  * Animation support
  * Browse only selected images
  * Navigation window
  * Set image as wallpaper (Cinnamon, FluxBox, Gnome 2, Gnome 3, hsetroot, LXDE, MATE, Nitrogen, Puppylinux, XFCE)
  * EXIF and IPTC metadata
  * Simple interface
  * Configurable mouse actions

Most of the Viewnior's sources handling image viewing are adopted from the GtkImageView library by Bj√∂rn Lindqvist. The files were cleaned up and modified, so that unused functionalities were removed (GtkImageToolSelector, GtkImageToolPainter, GtkZooms). Prefixes were changed from gtk_ to uni_ for clarity.
