## Viewnior - Fast and elegant image viewer

This is a fork of Viewnior Gtk3 :

From the original project by Siyan Panayotov :

Viewnior is an image viewer, created to be simple, fast and elegant. Its minimalistic interface provides more screenspace for your images. Among its features are:

  * Rotate, flip, crop, save, delete images
  * Copy, move, rename
  * Fullscreen & Slideshow
  * Animation support
  * Browse only selected images
  * Navigation window
  * Set image as wallpaper (Cinnamon, FluxBox, Gnome 2, Gnome 3, hsetroot, LXDE, MATE, Nitrogen, Puppylinux, XFCE)
  * EXIF and IPTC metadata
  * Simple interface
  * Configurable mouse actions

Most of the Viewnior's sources handling image viewing are adopted from the GtkImageView library by Björn Lindqvist. The files were cleaned up and modified, so that unused functionalities were removed (GtkImageToolSelector, GtkImageToolPainter, GtkZooms). Prefixes were changed from gtk_ to uni_ for clarity.
