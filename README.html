<h1>Viewnior - Fast and elegant image viewer</h1>

<p>This is a fork of : <a href="https://github.com/Artturin/Viewnior">https://github.com/Artturin/Viewnior</a><br>
From the original project : <a href="https://github.com/hellosiyan/Viewnior">https://github.com/hellosiyan/Viewnior</a>  </p>

<p>This is Viewnior, an image viewer program. Created to be simple, fast and elegant. Its minimalistic interface provides more screenspace for your images. Among its features are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fullscreen &amp; Slideshow</li>
<li>Rotate, flip, crop, save, delete images</li>
<li>Animation support</li>
<li>Browse only selected images</li>
<li>Navigation window</li>
<li>Set image as wallpaper (Gnome 2, Gnome 3, XFCE, MATE, Cinnamon, LXDE, FluxBox, Nitrogen, Puppylinux)</li>
<li>EXIF and IPTC metadata</li>
<li>Simple interface</li>
<li>Configurable mouse actions</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the Viewnior&#39;s sources handling image viewing are adopted from the GtkImageView library by Bj√∂rn Lindqvist. The files were cleaned up and modified, so that unused functionalities were removed (GtkImageToolSelector, GtkImageToolPainter, GtkZooms). Prefixes were changed from gtk_ to uni_ for clarity.</p>
